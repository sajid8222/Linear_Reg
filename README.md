Linear-Regression
We have managed to build a simple linear model to predict salary based on years of working experience. Based on our linear model, we can conclude that our salary is grown with our years of working experience and there is a linear relationship between them. We can use our linear model to predict the salary by giving input of years of experience.

Although this is a little too naive to presume the salary is only dependent on the years of working experience, this is one of the great examples to demonstrate how we can develop a simple linear regression model to show a relationship between two variables. In fact, most phenomena in real life cannot be easily explained by a linear model. However, the understanding of building a linear model is the foundation to build a complex model.
